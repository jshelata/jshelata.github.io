Requesting hint for number 4

Status:
We have brute forced our way into the communication website on =
weratepups.xyz <http://weratepups.xyz/> but are having trouble with the =
keys to use. We have been hashing the word =E2=80=9Ccollective=E2=80=9D =
with sha256 and then signing with the id_rsa found in /home/leslie/.keys =
and outputting as base64 with no luck. Could we have a hint?=
